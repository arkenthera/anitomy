# Anitomy with DLL linking

Weirdly original author just put the code files on Git without any build system.
I just added CMake compatibility and DLL linking by exporting each class.Maybe there is no need to export everything but 
I dont have the time to iterate through the code.

See original repo [here](https://github.com/erengy/anitomy)
